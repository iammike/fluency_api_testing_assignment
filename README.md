# Fluency API Testing Assignment
This project was to develop a handful of tests for Fluency's V2 API documented at [https://backpack-staging.fluencyinc.co/api-doc](https://backpack-staging.fluencyinc.co/api-doc).

Please see the [Fluency API Test Plan PDF](https://github.com/iammike/fluency_api_testing_assignment/blob/main/Fluency_Accounts_API_Test_Plan.pdf) for more information.

Note: Due to not having a test environment available, this code is not tested beyond visually. This also means that the error codes are assumed. The final note is that a portion of this work was done against V1 of the API as that what was provided initially, but I was able to clarify V2 should be used and have done my best to refactor for that.
